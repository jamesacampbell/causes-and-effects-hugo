# jamescampbell.us code

_website code for jamescampbell.us_

This site was built using [hugo](http://gohugo.io).

The code base here allows for me to do quick updates and deployments to new VPS's as necessary.

Hugo is amazing. It allows partial templating, global variable assignment and insertion using a TOML config file, and other nice things that make my dev life easier.
