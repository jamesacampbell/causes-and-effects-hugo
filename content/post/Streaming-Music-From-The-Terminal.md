Do you remember Rdio? It was a better music streaming service than Spotify.

In 2013, Entertainment Weekly compared a number of music services and judged Rdio the best, grading it "A" and writing that it had "by far the best app and online interface, making database searching and playlist curation easy" - [source][1]

Rdio ended up not finding the right business model, or spending too much of its 200 million, but it filed for bankruptcy in 2015 and Pandora purchased it and all of its assets for 75 million cash.

Fast forward to today, and I still use Pandora (I also am on [Spotify][2]). 

There still is no desktop client for Pandora. Or is there?

It turns out if you are on a mac and have [homebrew][3] installed, you can do <pre>brew install [pianobar][4]</pre> and you can access and stream music from the terminal, complete with keyboard shortcuts to change stations and thumb-up or thumb-down tracks.

It is one of the headless apps I use every day, so I thought I would share it. 

What apps are indispensible to you?
